## Where all the good characters go

This repository hosts all my nice TTRPG characters as they were in a book. That's it.

## Todo's

- Create this as a side project to try some new things.
- That's a book with many diferent styles per page.
- Each page will tell a story and the attributes of a character.
- Should not forget to add cool animations for the pages. And cool designs too.

## Tech

- Vanilla JS with some type flavour.
- Good old SCSS for the styles.
- Semantical HTML for templating.
- CSS Animations that really make this project cool.
